#   - CHECKMARX_URL
#   - CHECKMARX_USERNAME
#   - CHECKMARX_PASSWORD
#   - CHECKMARX_CLIENT_SECRET
#   - GH_TOKEN
#
# Update the 'team' field to reflect the team name used in Checkmarx.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel - this job is specifically configured to use the Checkmarx CxFlow Action
